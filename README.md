# Text2SpeechEditor
A notepad like apllication with Text-to-Speech functionality

## To Do
Document class has very low cohesion. Need to place it's methods in the appropriate classes. Same with TextToSpeechEditorView which needs some serious refactoring.
1. Maybe use Decorator pattern in order to define Scroll, Font, Font Size etc in the main window.
